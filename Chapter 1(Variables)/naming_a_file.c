/* While learning to C programming always keep these rules 
whenever you make a new C file and naming it .Because it has so confused aand irritate me when i got this problem.Here are the rules:
1: Dont make spaces in  your file name like variable and opreators.c, chapter 1.c etc

2: Dont use special character in the name except underscore(_) which is allowed.; #3variables.c, 2.5operators.c etc


3: DOnt use numbers in start like 4conditions.c etc

*/
// If you named your file like the above names you will got an error of undefined directory or unable to execute binary files or encoded files ehich looks like a big problem but it in your name of the file.

// So keep your name simple like variable_2.c,ifelse_statements.c etc .
